			<strong>runner-up in northeastern’s annual holiday card design contest</strong>

			<br>
			<br>
			every year, a campus-wide contest is held seeking designs for the university advancement holiday cards. these cards are sent to trustees, alumni, and university supporters. the design should not incorporate any specific religious holidays– instead, it should capture the spirit of both the holiday season and the northeastern community. 

			<br>
			<br>

			northeastern is full of bright ideas. i am thankful to be part of a flourishing community where i find myself surrounded by inspirational people and resources. i expressed this sentiment in my piece, which was one of the contest’s winning designs.

			<br>
			<br> 

			the most exciting part of this experience for me was that my artwork was displayed on the side of a recycling bin in the library quad! for a month, thousands of people walked past my work every day, which i find totally awesome.

			<strong>cbs corporate identity poster</strong>

			<br>
			<br>
			this project was for history of graphic design– i was required to research the importance of the cbs logo designed by william golden in 1951, write a 500 word essay on the topic, and design a 10 by 32 inch poster to display the research. 

			<br>
			<br>

			the cbs logo is black, so i maintained a black and white color scheme throughout the poster. i chose gold as an accent color because the time period being discussed is known as the golden age of television. the original font used for the logo was didot, so the main title of the poster is in didot bold. in more recent times, cbs has been using a font similar to gotham, so i decided to set all of the type on the poster is set in either gotham narrow light or bold.

			<strong>harry potter and the cursed child script </strong>

			<br>	
			<br>
			in typography I, we were asked to take the unformatted text of the script to any play and format it using character and paragraph styles in adobe indesign. the end result was to be a a uniquely designed book. 

			<br>
			<br>

			a total of four fonts were used throughout this book: akzidenz grotesk light, akzidenz grotesk medium, futura book, and garamond. because this play revolves around a new, younger generation of wizards, i used primarily sans-serif fonts to give it a modern feel. the stage directions were set in garamond, a serif font, to show contrast between what was to be spoken out loud versus acted out. hierarchy was established through the use of uppercase letters; titles, subtitles, and character names are in all caps and have a thicker stroke.
